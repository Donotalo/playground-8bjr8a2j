This chapter will focus on an important image format known as FIT (Flattened uImage Tree) image. It's a single image file containing various other images. U-Boot has support for reading FIT image files making it easy to deal with several images from a single file. The details can be found [here](https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot/blob/master/doc/uImage.FIT/howto.txt) for the curious readers.
