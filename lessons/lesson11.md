The reason Linux kernel couldn't boot in last chapter is because the initial RAM disk ([initrd](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/initrd.html)) was missing from the system. U-Boot didn't provide one. The main purpose of having an initrd is to decouple kernel and necessary OS components. The kernel could be small and other components and drivers can be loaded into the initrd to proceed. The initrd works as a RAM based file system where the kernel will copy necessary files to continue.
